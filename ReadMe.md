The Project SunCheck is designed to use the OpenWeatherMap.org API to see the weather for the new 5 days in the city of London.

To build the application, either downloaded workspace to your computer and open it with Android studio or point a GIT client like SourceTree to the Project URL and checkout the project and then open it in Android studio. Once in Android studio, you should be able to sync and build the project. 


The project uses MVP pattern. It also uses libraries like RXJava, Retrofit and Butterknife to produce clean and readable code. 

Given more time we could have iterated over the UX (maybe have 5 tabs with list), we could have enriched the content as the API gives us ton of information like wind speed and direction. We could have also make the location searchable.
